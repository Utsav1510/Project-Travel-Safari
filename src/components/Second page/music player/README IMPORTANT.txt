Hello Sir/Mam
This  website is designed by me ,i.e,by Utsav Punia and is 100% original(not copied from anywhere).
Some of the key points are:-

1. I tested this website on various laptops.What I noticed was that different laptops of different screen sizes have
   different resolution. Consequently, the output was different on different laptops. Hence, you are requested to
   please refer the screenshots of the webpages provided in the same directory and kindly set the resolution of the
   website accordingly in your system.

2. This website has been made by seeing the output in Chrome Browser and is fully functional in it. If it looks 
   wierd in your browser, kindly run it in Chrome Browser.

3. A new website will be opened(which is also designed by me) when you will click on any of the aritsts in the
  "Popular artist" section.

4. In the header marquee has been used for the links. If it is not being displayed please refresh the pg.

5. When you will decrease the width of any of my websites a button will be displayed in the right hand side near
   the header of the window. On clicking on it the related content should be displayed. If it is not displayed then
   kindly click it once again.

6. When you will hover on the menu button in popular releases or on the Queue header in the aside section a dropdown
   list will be displayed.
